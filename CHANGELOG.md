## [2.0.0] – macOS Tahoe Maintenance Toolkit  
### _Architectural rewrite & safety-first redesign_

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- Script **refuses to run as root**
- Aggressive cache deletion behavior removed
- Shell rc files are no longer sourced
- Destructive actions now require explicit confirmation
- Default execution mode is **audit-only**, not modification

---

### 🧠 Philosophy Shift
**Before:**  
- “Do maintenance” as a single action  
- Heavy cleanup regardless of system state  

**Now:**  
- Audit → decide → act  
- Maintenance is symptom-driven, not ritual-based  
- Safer-than-OnyX defaults with explicit opt-in for heavy tasks  

---

### 🧱 Core Architecture Changes
- Introduced modular, single-responsibility functions
- Centralized logging, confirmation, and execution wrappers
- Added strict bash mode: `set -Eeuo pipefail`
- Added signal handling and clean exit paths
- Introduced structured CLI flags and presets

---

### 🔐 Security Improvements
- Hard path assertions before any delete operation
- Removed `rm -rf` on broad directories
- Eliminated `source ~/.zshrc` and similar patterns
- Added dry-run support for all operations
- Explicit sudo boundaries for privileged commands
- Refuses execution on non-macOS systems

---

### 🧪 Safety & Reliability Enhancements
- Preflight checks:
  - Disk space pressure
  - Power source (AC vs battery)
  - Network reachability
- Guarded execution for:
  - Disk repair
  - Snapshot thinning
  - Spotlight reindex
  - Periodic scripts
  - DNS flush

---

### 📊 New System Visibility Features
- System posture report:
  - macOS version & build
  - Hardware summary
  - Storage overview
  - Security posture (FileVault, Gatekeeper, Firewall, SIP)
- Disk usage hotspot reporting (top space consumers)
- SMART status (best-effort)
- Spotlight indexing status
- Time Machine local snapshot listing

---

### 🔄 Update Management Improvements
- macOS updates:
  - List-only by default
  - Install only when explicitly requested
- Homebrew maintenance:
  - update / upgrade / cleanup
  - `brew doctor` summary
- Optional App Store updates via `mas`

---

### 🧹 Cleanup Behavior Changes
#### Removed
- Full cache directory wipes
- Blanket log deletion

#### Added
- Age-based log trimming (default: 30 days)
- Age-based cache trimming (files only, not directories)
- User confirmation before any cleanup
- Threshold-aware snapshot thinning

---

### 🚀 New Execution Presets
- `--all-safe`
  - Preflight
  - System report
  - Disk verification
  - Update listing
  - Space analysis
  - Light cleanup

- `--all-deep`
  - Includes all-safe
  - Snapshot thinning
  - Cache trimming
  - Periodic scripts
  - DNS flush
  - Spotlight reindex

---

### 🧰 New CLI Features
- `--dry-run` (no system changes)
- `--assume-yes` (non-interactive automation)
- Fine-grained task flags for all modules
- Tunable thresholds for disk pressure and cleanup age
- Full `--help` documentation

---

### 📝 Logging Improvements
- Timestamped logs per run
- Centralized log directory:
~/Library/Logs/upkeep-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log- Clear RUN vs DRY-RUN indicators
- Consistent success/warning/error markers

---

## [1.x.x] – Original Script (Uploaded Version)

### Characteristics
- Monolithic execution flow
- Mixed audit and destructive actions
- Aggressive cache deletion
- Implicit assumptions about environment
- Limited logging and no dry-run capability
- Sourced user shell configuration
- No confirmation gates for heavy actions

### Known Risks (Resolved in 2.0.0)
- Potential catastrophic deletes if variables resolved unexpectedly
- Cache and index rebuild churn causing performance regressions
- Non-deterministic behavior due to sourced rc files
- Lack of safety rails for disk repair or snapshot removal

---

## Upgrade Notes

This is a **deliberate, opinionated rewrite**, not a patch release.

If you relied on:
- “One command nukes everything” behavior  
- Forced cache rebuilds  
- Silent destructive cleanup  

You must now **explicitly request** those behaviors.

This change is intentional.

---

## Future Roadmap (Not Implemented Yet)

- Symptom-driven recommendation mode
- Automated health scoring
- Optional BATS test suite
- CI ShellCheck integration
- Optional GUI wrapper
- Signed / notarized distribution

---

**Bottom line:**  
Version 2.0.0 turns a useful personal script into a **maintainable, explainable, and safe system tool**.
