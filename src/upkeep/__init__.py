Upkeep - Keep Your Mac Healthy

A modern, safe-by-default maintenance toolkit for macOS.

This package provides advanced features beyond the bash core:
- Storage analysis and visualization
- Terminal UI (TUI) interface
- Web dashboard interface
- Duplicate file detection
- Advanced reporting

The bash script (upkeep.sh) remains the primary interface for
basic maintenance operations. Python components extend functionality
for more complex analysis and interactive features.
